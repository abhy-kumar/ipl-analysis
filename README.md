# IPL Analysis

It is December, my endsems for this semester have just finished and I was bored. I found this dataset on Kaggle, and decided to find some unique stats if I could from these.

The entire code is open source, and you are free to redistribute the images or reuse the code from here, although I definitely appreciate a slight mention if it was useful to anyone.

The main notebook file is ``ipl_stats.ipynb`` and also features comments from me in there. I suggest checking that one out first. You'll also know which images denote what without much fuss should you want any image from this repo. This notebook should also be a good enough intro to anyone looking to start wading into data analysis using python.
